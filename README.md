Requires [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/) or later. (Earlier versions may work but have not been tested.)

Unit tests use the [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/) framework.

Assuming that Python and pip are already installed, get started as follows:
1. Clone this Git repository
2. In the working directory, create a Python virtual environment, e.g. `python -m venv .venv`
3. Install required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
